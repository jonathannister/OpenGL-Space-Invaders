# OpenGL-Space-Invaders
# This is a Space Invaders inspired game where you play as the Millenium Falcon and dodge incoming asteroids. WASD are movement keys, use f to change camera position, and space to shoot a fireball which destroys any asteroids it collides with. Asteroids do not move for the first five seconds so that the player can get oriented. If the player collides with any asteroids, the game will end with no player movement allowed. Can zoom in using scroll. The player is bounded to always be within certain coordinates, and no forward or backwards movement is allowed.
